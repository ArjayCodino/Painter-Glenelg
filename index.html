                    <p style="padding-left: 21%;padding-right: 26%;">If you're renovating your home, you need to choose a quality painter and decorator in Glenelg. Not all painters are created equally, nor do they offer the same level of workmanship. <br>
                    <br>So it is important to meet and talk to the person who will do your job, not just a salesperson who is coming to do the quote. Ask questions about what base preparation they are likely to do before they start to paint, and how many coats of paint they will apply to your house. The more you ask, the more likely you are to get a top painting contractor in Glenelg. <br>
                    <br>All Coat Painting have been providing a premium service to locals for over 40 years. As a highly qualified father and son team, Brian, the owner and founder has over 4 decades as a house painter. <br>
                    <br>Brian's son Nick is in his own right a highly experienced contractor, having completed his apprenticeship under the highly prestigious training of the Master Painters Assoc of SA. Nick himself has over 12 years as an experienced painting contractor. <br>
                    <br>For a free written, no obligation quote then contact the team at All Coat Painting. They are more than happy to quote all areas no matter how large or small your needs may be. All quotes are prompt and detailed to avoid ambiguity and so you can clearly see the quality these guys put into their work.</p>
